## Number of Shots - Just another drinking game?

**Background**

Hi! I'm Jane. This is my first time building an iOS app from scratch. My goal is to make an app that works well, even if it's not perfect. Thank you for your patience as I learn.

**Idea**

Number of Shots was born one night while my friends and I were hanging out. We had just finished playing 'Truth or Dare' and 'King's Cup' back to back. (We love these games, don't get me wrong.) After the hilarious moment when the king drank a cup of disgusting liquid, we all fell into silence. It was past midnight, everyone was a little tipsy, and it felt like the perfect time for more interesting conversations. But how do you start those when you've been friends for so long and it feels like you already know everything about each other? We could have gone back to karaoke and sung our hearts out, but I wished there was another way to keep having fun while getting to know each other better. And that's how Number of Shots came to be.
