## Number of Shots - Just another drinking game?

**Background**

Hi! I'm Jane. I just started learning iOS development. My goal is to make an app that works well, even if it's not perfect. That being said, you'll notice `TODOs` throughout my code. Thank you for your patience as I learn!

**Idea**

Number of Shots was born one night while my friends and I were hanging out. We had just finished playing 'Truth or Dare' and 'King's Cup' back to back. (Don't get me wrong, we love these games.) After the hilarious moment when the king drank the cup of disgusting liquid, we all fell into silence. It was past midnight, everyone was a little tipsy, and it felt like the perfect time for interesting conversations. But how do you start when you've been friends for so long and it feels like you were done talking about everything under the sun? We could have gone back to karaoke and sung our hearts out, but I wished there was another way. And that's how Number of Shots came to be.
